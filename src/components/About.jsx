            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>
                I'm Taranpreet Singh, a 19-year-old Bachelor of Computer Applications
                (BCA) student at Don Bosco Institute of Technology, affiliated with
                IPU. My intellectual curiosity spans the diverse landscape of
                technology, with a primary focus on Full Stack Web Development. I
                possess an insatiable drive to architect and actualize sophisticated
                digital solutions, transcending the conventional boundaries of
                front-end aesthetics and back-end complexities. Beyond my core
                pursuit, I am perpetually eager to assimilate novel technologies and
                methodologies, with a particular fascination for the transformative
                potential of Artificial Intelligence and the intricate artistry of
                Graphic Design.
